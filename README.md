# Mobile Coding Challenge (90 minutes)

This repo containing an existing Xcode project and workspace. Please ensure that you have the latest version of Xcode, accompanying command line tools, and CocoaPods.

The project is a shell for a photo viewing application. We would like you to build an app with the following features:

· List view for albums

· Grid view to display photo thumbnails for an album

· Photo view to view the full resolution version of the photo

You are your own designer here so feel free to make it as fancy or as barebones as you’d like, just make sure you can complete what you set out to do in the time provided.

You will find a class called NetworkService that has some pre-built API calls. You may need to add additional calls here to fulfill your objectives. You don’t need to use the same pattern for the existing calls, but it is there for your convenience. You can also add whatever pods will help you achieve your goals. You will be using the API hosted here: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com. The website has additional information about the API.
